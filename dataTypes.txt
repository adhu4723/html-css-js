 Primitive Data Types
Primitive types are immutable (cannot be changed) and stored directly in memory.

Types of Primitive Data Types:
1)String → Represents text
let name = "Alice";

2)Number → Represents integers & floating-point numbers
let age = 25;

3)Boolean → Represents true or false
let isStudent = true;

4)Undefined → A variable declared but not assigned a value
let x;
console.log(x); // undefined

5)Null → Represents an intentional absence of value
let y = null;

Characteristics of Primitive Data Types
Stored directly in memory (stack).
Immutable (cannot be modified).
Copied by value.

 Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types

Types of Non-Primitive Data Types:

1)Object → Collection of key-value pairs
let person = { name: "Bob", age: 30 };

2)Array → Ordered collection of elements
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

3)Function → Executable code
function greet() {
    return "Hello!";
}
Characteristics of Non-Primitive Data Types
Stored in memory (heap) and accessed by reference.
Mutable (can be modified).
Copied by reference.
